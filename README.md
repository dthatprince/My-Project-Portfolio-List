### Analyzing the Scala Programming Language Repository

I analyzed the development history of the Scala programming language by reading, cleaning, and visualizing data from its real-world project repository. 

The dataset included information about pull requests and the files that were modified by each request, which were previously mined and extracted from GitHub. I used Python to read, clean, and visualize the data to identify the individuals who had the most influence on Scala's development and determine the language experts. 

I also explored trends in the development of Scala over time to gain insights into its evolution as an open-source project. By the end of the project, I had developed my data manipulation, visualization, and analysis skills using Python and gained a better understanding of the development of the Scala programming language.
